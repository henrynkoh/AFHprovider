# Master the Search: Advanced Features You Need to Know

In our last newsletter, we introduced you to AFH Provider Matching. This week, we're diving deep into the search features that make finding providers so easy and efficient.

## Multiple Ways to Search

### Basic Text Search
Simply type what you're looking for in the search bar. Our system searches across all provider fields simultaneously - business names, provider names, cities, phone numbers, websites, and additional notes. The search is comprehensive, ensuring you don't miss relevant providers.

### Quick Filter Buttons
For common searches, use our one-click filter buttons:
- **Centralia** - Shows all providers in Centralia
- **Medicaid** - Shows all Medicaid providers
- **LLC** - Shows all Limited Liability Companies

No typing required - just click and go!

### Phone Number Search
Know a provider's phone number? Type it in (full or partial) to find that specific provider. Perfect when you have a number but can't remember the business name.

### Combination Searches
Combine multiple search terms for ultra-specific results:
- "Centralia Medicaid" - Medicaid providers in Centralia
- "LLC 360" - LLC providers with 360 area code
- "Care Home Centralia" - Care homes in Centralia

## Intelligent Search Features

### Fuzzy Matching
Don't remember the exact spelling? No problem! Our fuzzy matching algorithm finds providers even with typos or partial names. Type "Arian" and you'll find "Arianna Care" - it's that smart!

### Case-Insensitive
Type in uppercase, lowercase, or mixed case - it doesn't matter. Our search works the same way regardless of capitalization.

### Real-Time Results
As you type, results update instantly. No need to press Enter or click a search button - just type and watch results appear in real-time.

### Partial Matching
You don't need the complete name. Partial matches work perfectly, making it easy to find providers even when you only remember part of the name.

## Pro Search Tips

1. **Start Broad, Then Narrow**: Begin with a general search, then add more specific terms
2. **Use Unique Words**: If a business name is common, use unique parts for better results
3. **Combine Location + Type**: Combine location with business type for precision
4. **Search by Area Code**: Type phone area codes to find providers in specific regions
