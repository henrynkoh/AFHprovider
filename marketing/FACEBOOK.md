## 🎯 Post 2: Feature Highlight - Advanced Search

---

**Headline**: 🔍 Find Any AFH Provider in Seconds - Our Advanced Search Makes It Easy!

**Post Content**:

Searching for the right AFH provider shouldn't feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. That's why we've built one of the most powerful and intuitive search systems in the industry - and it's completely free to use!

**🎯 Multiple Search Methods:**

Our platform offers several ways to find exactly what you're looking for:

**1. Basic Text Search:**
Simply type what you're looking for in our search bar, and watch the magic happen! Our intelligent search system looks through:
- Business names (e.g., "Arianna Care LLC")
- Provider names
- City and location information
- Phone numbers (partial matches work too!)
- Website URLs
- Additional notes and descriptions

**2. Quick Filter Buttons:**
Need to find providers in Centralia? Looking for Medicaid providers? Want to see all LLC businesses? Just click one of our quick filter buttons for instant results. No typing required - one click and you're there!

**3. Advanced Combination Searches:**
Combine multiple search terms for ultra-specific results. For example:
- "Centralia Medicaid" - Find all Medicaid providers in Centralia
- "LLC 360" - Find LLC providers with 360 area code phone numbers
- "Care Home Centralia" - Find care homes specifically in Centralia

**4. Phone Number Search:**
Know a provider's phone number? Type it in (full or partial) and find them instantly. This is perfect when you have a phone number but can't remember the business name.

**✨ Smart Features:**

**Fuzzy Matching:**
Don't remember the exact spelling? No problem! Our fuzzy matching algorithm finds providers even with partial or misspelled search terms. Type "Arian" and you'll find "Arianna Care" - it's that smart!

**Case-Insensitive:**
Type in uppercase, lowercase, or mixed case - it doesn't matter. Our search works the same way regardless of how you capitalize your search terms.

**Real-Time Results:**
As you type, results update instantly. No need to press Enter or click a search button - just type and watch the results appear in real-time.

**Partial Matching:**
You don't need to type the complete name. Partial matches work perfectly, making it easy to find providers even when you only remember part of the name.

**🎨 Visual Search Experience:**

Our search bar features a beautiful animated gradient border that appears when you focus on it, making the search experience not just functional, but visually appealing too. The search icon provides clear visual feedback, and the clear button (X) appears when you have text entered, making it easy to start a new search.

**📊 Search Results Display:**

When you perform a search, you'll see:
- **Instant Results Count**: Know immediately how many providers match your search
- **Highlighted Matches**: Easy to see which providers match your criteria
- **Sortable Results**: Click any column header to sort results alphabetically or numerically
- **Detailed Information**: Each result shows complete provider information

**💡 Pro Search Tips:**

1. **Start Broad, Then Narrow**: Begin with a general search (like "Centralia"), then add more specific terms to narrow down results.

2. **Use Unique Words**: If a business name is common, use unique parts of the name for better results. For example, search "Arianna" instead of "Care" to find "Arianna Care LLC" more easily.

3. **Combine Location + Type**: Combine location with business type for precise results. "Centralia LLC" will show you all LLC providers in Centralia.

4. **Search by Payment Type**: Looking for specific payment options? Search "Medicaid" or "Private Pay" to find providers matching your payment preferences.

5. **Use Area Codes**: Search by phone area code to find providers in specific regions. Type "360" to find all providers with 360 area code numbers.

Ready to experience the power of our advanced search? Visit our platform and try searching for:
- Your city name
- A business type (LLC, AFH, Home, Care)
