These give you immediate context about data scope and quality.

### **Step 3: Perform Your First Basic Search** 🔍
Click the search bar and type a simple term like **"Centralia"**. Watch results update in **real-time** as you type. **Try these**: "Centralia", "Medicaid", or "LLC" for instant results.

### **Step 4: Use Quick Filter Buttons** ⚡
Click quick filter buttons (**Centralia**, **Medicaid**, **LLC**) for one-click access to common searches. The search bar auto-populates and results update instantly. **No typing required!**

### **Step 5: Understand Provider Table Columns** 📋
Learn each column:
- **Area/City** - Location (e.g., "Centralia, WA")
- **Business Name** - Official business name
- **Provider Name** - Contact person name
- **Phone Number** - Click-to-call on mobile
- **Website** - External links to provider sites

### **Step 6: Sort Providers by Different Criteria** ↕️
Click column headers to sort:

- **Business Name** → A-Z alphabetical
- **Year Started** → By experience (oldest/newest)
- **Resident Beds** → By capacity (smallest/largest)

Click again to reverse order. Visual indicators (▲/▼) show sort direction.

### **Step 7: Search by Phone Number** 📞
Type phone numbers (full or partial) in search bar:
- **"360"** → Finds all 360 area code providers
- **"360807"** → Finds specific number ranges
- **Full 10-digit** → Exact match

Perfect when you have a number but not the business name!

### **Step 8: Combine Multiple Search Terms** 🔗
Type multiple words separated by spaces:
- **"Centralia Medicaid"** → Medicaid providers in Centralia
- **"LLC 360"** → LLC providers with 360 area code
- **"Care Home Centralia"** → Care homes in Centralia

Platform matches **ALL terms** - order doesn't matter!

### **Step 9: Use Advanced Filtering Strategies** 🎯
Combine search with sorting for powerful results:

### **Step 11: Interpret Provider Status Indicators** 🎨
Learn visual indicators:

- **🟡 Yellow badges** - No direct phone (use AFHC link)

Icons: 📞 (phone), ↗ (external link), ● (active status)

### **Step 12: Search for Providers by Specialty** 🏥
Search specialty terms:
- **"Dementia"** - Dementia care specialists
- **"Developmental Disabilities"** - Developmental disability support
- **"Mental Health"** - Mental health specialized care
- **"Private Duty Nursing"** - Providers with nursing services

Review **"Others"** column for detailed specialty information.

### **Step 13: Compare Multiple Providers Side-by-Side** ⚖️
Use sorting and filtering to organize:
1. Search matching criteria
2. Sort by important metric
3. Review multiple providers in sorted list
4. Document key differences

**Compare**: Experience, capacity, payment types, specialties, location.

### **Step 14: Find Providers by Business Structure** 🏢
Search business types:
- **"LLC"** - Limited Liability Companies
- **"AFH"** - Adult Family Homes
- **"Home"**, **"Care"**, **"Manor"** - Business name patterns

2. Check provider website for additional methods
3. Cross-reference with other sources
4. Note any changes

Phone numbers may change, businesses may close.
